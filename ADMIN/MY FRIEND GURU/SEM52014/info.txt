- id generated using code or autoincrement
- unm in register table is not primary key but we manage it through code
e.g., when user fills the registration form we check given unm is already exist in table or not using AJAX.
- never enter value for autoincrement field.
- generally change the name of uploaded file or image while saving to server and entering path in table.
- use die() with proper message
- never allow user to update id
- set alternate color of row using if, counter and css
